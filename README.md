This example contains data with random names of random persons, their age,
their favourite color, ice cream, favourite movie, and favourite programming
language.

We can build the example up by reading the csv file, filtering by age,
evaluating the most favourite color or movie.

One can do interesting queries with it without plotting the data since plotting
can be technically a challenge at first. But no problem to introduce plotting
later.

Later we can write our own average function for the age and automatically test
it. Or implement a function for a rolling average and test it.
